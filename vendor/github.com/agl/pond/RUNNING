Ensure that your environment is configured for running golang programs. See
http://golang.org/doc/code.html for details, but you should have something
similar to the following setup:

  export GOPATH=$HOME/go
  export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

Adjust these path locations to fit your Go environment.

Launch the GUI for Pond on GNU/Linux and similar operating systems:

  $GOPATH/bin/client

To run the Pond CLI:

  $GOPATH/bin/client --cli
